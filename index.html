        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, I am Yadira Oseguera in the University of California- Riverside. I am in my third year of attending and I am aiming to recieve my major in sociology. I have been very active in school and outside of school.I am studying sociology because this has been something that has always interested me, it explores how these social structures and systems shape individual behavior and experiences, and how they are influenced by larger social and historical forces.

 I've been working in different areas but my main position is at the Valverde District where I do some accounting. Accounting is typically recorded in financial statements, which include the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. These statements provide a snapshot of the company's financial position, performance, and cash flows. Accounting also involves other tasks, such as financial analysis, budgeting, forecasting, and auditing. I graduated Highschool in 2020, which was when lockdown occured which was something very difficult we went 
 through as a nation.The pandemic has also affected people's social lives, with many experiencing isolation and loneliness due to social distancing measures. Many have also had to cancel or postpone important events like weddings, graduations, and family gatherings. The pandemic has caused widespread job losses and economic disruptions, with many businesses closing or reducing their operations. Many people have experienced financial hardship, including difficulty paying bills and accessing basic necessities like food and healthcare. The pandemic has disrupted education for millions of students around the world, with many schools closing or switching to remote learning. This has created challenges for students, parents, and teachers, including difficulty accessing technology and maintaining engagement with remote learning. During Covid I was able to learn more about myself and try to stand out more. Covid gave me time to read and organize myself better, such as reading more news and keeping up with what was going on. Covid also helped me adapt better to follow Covid guidlines such as quaranting 
 and staying 6 feet away from people. Also, commiting to wearing face masks out in public to prevent the spread. Covid got me closer to my family and friends, and made me see the importance of appreciating all the time we have.<br><br>

        My life outside of school and work consists of being with my family and playing sports. My family is quite large with my parents and my 5 siblings. We normally try to keep a consistent habit of being productive together or having a healthy diet such as exerxising. Some stuff I like to do on my free time is go to the gym, play spots, or bake. I began going to the gym at the age of 7 to just keep a healthy balance in my life, my parents would always take me and normally I would just 
        swim or run on the treadmill. As I grew up I began exploring machines and being able to help others. After 8 years of going to the gym I was able to join a program to help people who have a disablility and require an additional help. Many of the people who I help are people who require physical therapy. Physical therapy is often used in conjunction with other medical treatments and may be recommended by a physician as part of a comprehensive treatment plan. The goal of physical therapy 
        is to help patients achieve their maximum physical potential and improve their quality of life. This can involve helping patients recover from an injury or surgery, manage a chronic condition, or improve their strength and flexibility. Some sports I play are soccer, tennis, and softball. I mainly have played soccer when I was younger and my parents put me in a club around the community. Tennis and Softball really interested me and was something I did on my own when I was in middle school. 
        When I entered High School I played Tennis and Softball both on Varsity as a freshman. Playing sports is an excellent way to maintain good physical health. Sports provide opportunities for exercise, which helps individuals to maintain a healthy weight, improve cardiovascular health, and build strong bones and muscles. Playing sports requires discipline and dedication. Athletes learn to set goals, work hard, and persevere in the face of challenges, which can help to develop discipline and self-control.
        Playing sports is an excellent way to relieve stress and improve mental health. Exercise releases endorphins, which can help to improve mood and reduce anxiety and depression. Also, Playing sports can help to improve self-confidence and self-esteem. As individuals improve their skills and abilities, they feel more confident in their ability to succeed both on and off the field. Baking for me is something I do to get time off of work and school. Baking  allows me to be creative and try new things 
        without having an rules or limitations. Baking requires a lot of focus and attention to detail, which can help individuals to be more present in the moment and less focused on other stresses and worries. Baking is a creative process that allows individuals to express themselves through the use of ingredients and decorations. This can be a satisfying and enjoyable experience that promotes relaxation. Baking allows individuals to create something from scratch, and seeing the finished product can provide a sense of accomplishment and pride.
        Baking is often associated with feelings of warmth and comfort, as it is often associated with childhood memories and family traditions. Engaging in this activity can provide a sense of nostalgia and promote relaxation.Baking is a process that involves following a recipe and taking specific steps to achieve a desired outcome. This sense of control and structure can help individuals to feel more in control of their lives and reduce feelings of stress and anxiety.

        I have worked in a few areas that have helped me develop a better customer service skill and how to work as a team. Jobs can expose individuals to new ideas and perspectives that can broaden their understanding and skillset. This can be through working with people from different backgrounds or industries, or through exposure to new technologies and practices. Jobs provide opportunities for individuals to receive feedback and evaluation on their performance. This can help individuals to identify areas where they need to improve and develop strategies to address those areas.
        Jobs provide opportunities for individuals to network with others in their industry or field. This can lead to new opportunities for skills development, such as attending conferences or workshops, or finding mentors who can help guide their career development.Overall, jobs can be an excellent way for individuals to develop their skills and advance their careers. By providing opportunities for training, practice, feedback, exposure, and networking, jobs can help individuals to continually improve their skills and stay competitive in their field. My first job was when I turned 16, I worked at Subway. 
        It was scary at first because during the interview it was a lot of older people who were dressed professionally and had a resume to show. I went in with no work experience or had any idea what to expect in the interview nor the job itself. When I got the call back that I was hired I was beyond happy, but the only reason I was hired was because I had the most availabilty than most of the ones who went to the interview. I wanted to prove myself that I was a good worker and that I was capable of being just an easy availabilty. I learned the prep fast and how to make the subs. 
        Before I knew it in just less than a week I had all the stuff memorized so when I went into work, my manger was going to show me but I went in knowing as much as I studied. This impressed my manager a lot that she quickly gave me a full time schedule and I was rated best employee amongst the customers. 
        After 2 years I left Subway because I wanted to grow and have more opportunities. I applied to Carls Jr and got the job. I was a cashier for roughly 4 months until I got promoted to a shift leader. This was amazing because I was able to learn more manager duties such as count the inventory and handle more sales details. Even when my manger leaves on vacation I'm able to help with making the weeks schedule and guide everyone and help cover breaks without needing to call my manager. I began to train to be a manager after a year of working there and I still work there as an assistant manager.The shift
        leader is responsible for supervising the team members working on their shift, ensuring they are performing their duties correctly and efficiently. They may also provide training and coaching to new employees. Recently, I got a job to be a school districts accountance. This has by far challeneged me the most but I feel like this is where I can learn and expand on my skills.
